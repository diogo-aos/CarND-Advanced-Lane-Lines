I've started the project by exploring some of the transformation done in class.
Namely, I've been tring the Sobel direction, magnitude direction and saturation
threshold. Of these, the saturation threshold is clearly better than the rest.
In all test images, it gets the lines quite well. However, it seems to be having
problems with shadows.

I've been using some code to adjust the parameters of these transformations
interactevely and that helped a lot.
